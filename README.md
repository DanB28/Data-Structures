<h1>Data-Structures</h1>
Data Structure Projects that are implemented in python 3.6. Below is a list of of projects and how to run them

<h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
Open up bubble Sort folder and open the bd_bubblesort file and run module or migrate and run it through a terminal

<h1>DFS_Graph_Queue</h1>
<p>This folder contains the following files</p>
<li>
<ul>DFS</ul>
<ul>Graph</ul>
<ul>Main</ul>
<ul>pythonds</ul>
<ul>Queue</ul>
<ul>Vetex</ul>
</li>

<p>to run, open and run main.py, then you will get the following options</p>
<li>
<ul>Main Menu </ul>
<ul>1	Input a graph from the keyboard </ul>
<ul>2	Input a graph from a file </ul>
<ul>3	View graph </ul>
<ul>4	Single-source shortest path </ul>
<ul>5	All-pairs shortest path </ul>
<ul>6	Topological sort </ul>
<ul>7	Exit the program </ul>
</li>

<p>when entering a frome keyboard make sure its in the following format</p>
<li>
<ul>Enter your selection[1-7]: 1 </ul>
 
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: A-B: 80 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: B-C: 79 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: B-E: 153 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: C-D: 78 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: C-F: 74 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: D-E: 98 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: D-F: 89 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: F-G: 67 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit: D-F: 89 </ul>
<ul>Enter an edge or return to quit:  </ul>
<ul>Graph created successfully </ul>
</li>

<p>After the graph is imported or created, you then can select options for the graph</p>
<li>
<ul>3) view</ul>
<ul>4) single source shortest path </ul>
<ul>5) all-pairs shortest path</ul>
<ul>6) topological sort</ul>
<ul>or press 7 to quit</ul>
</li>
<h1>Hash Table</h1>
<p>This foler contains three files that will implement a hash table. 
to run select either hashtableNums.py or hashTableNames.py and run in idle or go to the directory in a terminal and run
the hashtableNums, puts a 100 random int from 1 to 100 into a hash table and the hashtableNames will put names of people into a hash table</p>

<h1>Linked List</h1>
<p>open files in idle and run</br>
displays ordered and unordered linked lists.</p>

<h1>minheap </h1>
<p>display the use of a minheap</br>
open and run in idle or run from a terminal</br>

<h1>Tree Project</h1>
<p>Displays use of a tree
</br>open main in idle and comment out and comment previous function for which file you want to run.
</br>Tree_project_Testing folder contains test files and tree program with the test explanations for this project</p>

<h1>Trees</h1>
<p>Displays the use of trees
</br>contains three files 
</br>median_of_trees
</br>Sum_of_trees
</br>tree_class
</p>

<h1>Word Count and encrypt</h1>
<p>This folder contains the files for diplaying the use of encrypting a phrase, "run_encrypt.py", you will run the program in idle
or a terminal, enter follow the instructions, after entering the phrase you can then coppy paste the output and de-encrypt it using 
the same key value as you used to encrypt it.</br>
ex: </br>
enter a phrase: hello</br>
enter a key value between 1 and 9: 4</br>
enter 1 to encode or enter 2 to decode: 1</br>
lipps</br>
^this is the encrypted code now re-run program and enter this in for phrase</br>
enter a phrase: lipps</br>
enter a key value between 1 and 9: 4 (must be same as when encrypted)</br>
enter 1 to encode, enter 2 to decode: 2</br>
hello</br>
^decodes back to original message</br>
</p>

<p>The Filestats.py file has two functions which you can run in idle like so</br>
filestats('testfile.txt') --> this function will tell you about the number of characters, number of lines, number of words and top 10 most used words</br>
or wordcount(testfile.txt') --> this function will tell you the top ten used words and the number of times they occur, this function in in the stats function as well</br>
bill.txt is also another test file to test with</p>

<h1>quick_sort/quicksort2</h1>
<p>Two displays for quick sort algorithm</br>
run in idle or terminal</p>
