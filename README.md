Data-Structures
Data Structure Projects that are implemented in python 3.6. Below is a list of of projects and how to run them

Bubble Sort
Open up bubble Sort folder and open the bd_bubblesort file and run module or migrate and run it through a terminal

DFS_Graph_Queue
This folder contains the following files 
DFS
Graph
Main
pythonds
Queue
Vetex

to run, open and run main.py, then you will get the following options,
Main Menu 
1	Input a graph from the keyboard 
2	Input a graph from a file 
3	View graph 
4	Single-source shortest path 
5	All-pairs shortest path 
6	Topological sort 
7	Exit the program 

when entering a frome keyboard make sure its in the following format,
Enter your selection[1-7]: 1 
 
Enter an edge or return to quit: A-B: 80 
Enter an edge or return to quit: B-C: 79 
Enter an edge or return to quit: B-E: 153 
Enter an edge or return to quit: C-D: 78 
Enter an edge or return to quit: C-F: 74 
Enter an edge or return to quit: D-E: 98 
Enter an edge or return to quit: D-F: 89 
Enter an edge or return to quit: F-G: 67 
Enter an edge or return to quit: D-F: 89 
Enter an edge or return to quit:  
Graph created successfully 

After the graph is imported or created, you then can select options for the graph, 
3) view
4) single source shortest path 
5) all-pairs shortest path
6) topological sort
or press 7 to quit

#Hash Table
THis foler contains three files that will implement a hash table. 
to run select either hashtableNums.py or hashTableNames.py and run in idle or go to the directory in a terminal and run
the hashtableNums, puts a 100 random int from 1 to 100 into a hash table and the hashtableNames will put names of people into a hash table

#Linked List
open files in idle and run
displays ordered and unordered linked lists.

#minheap 
display the use of a minheap
open and run in idle or run from a terminal

#Tree Project
Displays use of a tree
open main in idle and comment out and comment previous function for which file you want to run.
Tree_project_Testing folder contains test files and tree program with the test explanations for this project

#Trees
Displays the use of trees
contains three files, 
median_of_trees
Sum_of_trees
tree_class

#Word Count and encrypt
This folder contains the files for diplaying the use of encrypting a phrase, "run_encrypt.py", you will run the program in idle
or a terminal, enter follow the instructions, after entering the phrase you can then coppy paste the output and de-encrypt it using 
the same key value as you used to encrypt it.
ex: >>>enter a phrase: hello
>>> enter a key value between 1 and 9: 4
>>> enter 1 to encode or enter 2 to decode: 1
lipps
^this is the encrypted code now re-run program and enter this in for phrase
>>> enter a phrase: lipps
>>> enter a key value between 1 and 9: 4 (must be same as when encrypted)
>>> enter 1 to encode, enter 2 to decode: 2
hello
^decodes back to original message

The Filestats.py file has two functions which you can run in idle like so
filestats('testfile.txt') --> this function will tell you about the number of characters, number of lines, number of words and top 10 most used words
or wordcount(testfile.txt') --> this function will tell you the top ten used words and the number of times they occur, this function in in the stats function as well
bill.txt is also another test file to test with

#quick_sort/quicksort2
Two displays for quick sort algorithm
run in idle or terminal
